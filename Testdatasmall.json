test pages for the web service contain examples of the \r\nsoap method calls in ie these are incredibly easy to read however in \r\nchrome there seems to be some attempt to squash the text to fit the window \r\nand the font is therefore very difficult to read my understanding is the \r\nie uses smoothfont technology to make the text easier to read and some \r\nsimilar feature in chrome is really needed we all spend a lot of time \r\nlooking at web pages and the font used and the way the text is rendered is \r\nincredibly important otherwise so far ive been impressed \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwhat is

a hardcoded css definition inside chrome\r\n\r\ninputwebkitautofill  backgroundcolor faffbd important background\r\nimagenone important \r\n\r\nthe important keyword makes it impossible to change autofill background \r\nto anything else than this color  as it turns out using background images \r\nhere would be difficult as well\r\ni especially tested safari windows for having this bug and found out \r\nthat it works very well having no undesired behavior additionally safari \r\nhas the autofill option for user input turned off by default unlike \r\nchrome  it might be also not very obvious for average user how to turn \r\nthis option off in chrome so they would see the ugly partially colored \r\nrounded input boxes as on the screenshot i am attaching\r\nas you can see in this case the special behaviour of your browser \r\nbecomes a real bug as it cant be turned off i believe that using css3 \r\nrounded input boxes would give more beautiful output but i will not use \r\nthem sooner than ie and opera would have support for them for some 5 years \r\nor so anyway yellow should not be used on this particular site at all  \r\nmy customer is very picky about such things  how can i make him happy when \r\nchrome is going to capture a considerable amount of the market in the next \r\nfew months but ie will still be the most used browser\r\n\r\nso i strongly suggest you to remove important keywords from the above \r\nmentioned definitions as soon as possible  well please remove it\r\n\r\nthe forced input outline highlight is also a bad idea in my opinion

here\r\n\r\nhttpwebgeniusconztemplaternavjs\r\n\r\nand the unpacked version of that code is here\r\n\r\nhttpwwwwebgeniusconzoriginaltemplaternavjs\r\n\r\nits a pretty simple twodimensional array that uses parentid the\r\nfirst argument to the addlink method as the key for the first level\r\nand linkid the second argument as the key for the second level\r\n\r\ni cant see why the array is getting out of order and i also cant\r\nsee any logic to the way the array is being reordered although its\r\nvery late here and im probably just missing it\r\n\r\nlet me know if you need more info\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nmatt\r\n\r\n\n", "issue_title": "JS bug - array elements out of order", "id": 1127}, {"reported_time": "2008-09-05 02:36:34", "issue_id": 1352, "owner": "", "description":

 once they were cached he \r\nthen went 515 minutes before he could visit these effectively black \r\nlisted sites\r\n\r\nhe reported that he was able to resolve the problem by a disabling the dns \r\nprefetch feature b flushing his os cache via ipconfig flushdns  he \r\ndidnt indicate if he also restarted chromium\r\n\r\nim going to post to the blog and ask that he add some details to this \r\nreport\r\n\r\nhe mentioned he was ussing att dsl and windows xp os\r\n\r\nid like to hear what router hes using as there is a chance that the \r\nrouter is overloaded by the series of dns resolutions done by chrome and \r\nbegins to errantly return no such name responses  once xp gets such a \r\nresolution i think it only caches those negative resolutions for less \r\nthan a minutebut the network stack inside chromium that were using \r\nmay cache it for closer to 30 minutes  that secondary application cache is \r\npossibly the reason why ie which uses the same network stack library has \r\nthe feature of ignoring ttl time to live data in a dns resolution  \r\nside note chromium in currently replacing the network stack and will \r\neventually have different features and response so this bug may be \r\nclosed once weve completed \r\n\r\nthere is also a possibility that the users isp is returning errant name \r\nnot found results  however i would have expected that such errant \r\nresults would result in a lot of bug reports on this which i have yet to \r\nsee\r\n\r\nthe post also tangentially mentioned wikipedia which usually has a lot of \r\ndomain names on

see \r\nthe counts before and after you have to do a page refresh after to update \r\nthe stats  it is possible that the visit to wikipedia tickles some sort \r\nof overload bug in the users lans dns

white tab it looks similar to issue \r\n311 but the page doesnt show anything in the end no matter how long you \r\nwait view page source shows that there is a lot of html in the source \r\nso the page should not be blank javascript console also doesnt suggest \r\nthat there is any bug\r\n\r\nrefresh fixes the problem\r\n\r\nunfortunately there is no clear sequence of steps to reproduce it it is \r\nalways by surprise but happens quite regularly once in a few days it \r\nis not introduced recently  it has been happening for a while already\r\n\r\ni believe it more often happens when you navigate to pages under httphabrahabrru  eg today it happened at httphabrahabrrublogsandroid43607\r\n\r\ninteresting bit i tried to save the source to attach it to the bug right\r\nclick save as chose web page html only given a name clicked save \r\nthe file name appeared in the download bar with the status cancelled \r\nright away next try with another name gave cancelled again though \r\nweb page complete saved something  i attach it under savedpagehtm\r\n\r\nunfortunately view source window doesnt have any save as capability \r\nshould i file it separately i had to copypaste the contents to \r\nnotepad\r\n\r\napparently the files look different therefore there seem to be several \r\nissues\r\n\r\n1 may be thats habrahabrru sending the unfinished page did anyone \r\nexperience this in other browsers may be chrome can show more prominently \r\nthat it has actually rendered everything and there is nothing left to wait \r\nbecause right now completely white screen looks as a reason to wait for the \r\nfinish of rendering see issue 311\r\n2 save as for html only doesnt work\r\n3 save as for web page complete produces different source from what we \r\ncan see in view source does it mean that view source does additional \r\nfetch of the page instead of showing the source of actual page visible\r\n4 view source window doesnt have save as feature\r\n5 also view source window title is loading which is some what \r\nstrange it would be nicer if it was source of the page at  or \r\nsomething like that\n", "issue_title": "sometimes instead of rendered page only white screen is

only happen briefly when you first \r\nlogin and when someone signs in clicking the a button to change font \r\nsettings brings up the utility but the font choice dropdown box is not \r\nthere and neither is the font size dropdown box no buttons such as an \r\nok or cancel button are present buttons to close windows such as the x \r\nin the corner are there clicking any of the utility links at the top \r\nsuch as accounts preferences etc brings up the appropriate window \r\nbut there is nothing in that window and usually causes the a oops meebo \r\ndetected a network interruption please check your network connection \r\nerror message the buttons at the top of the buddy list for adding a buddy \r\nblocking a buddy etc do not work at all\r\n\r\n2 page loads completely but with error messages one message is oops \r\nmeebo detected a network interruption please check your network \r\nconnection and another message is relating to not being able to login to \r\na specific im account such as aim sometimes usually after the website \r\nhas been loaded for a while when you doubleclick a screenname to send an \r\nim nothing happens the im box does not show up the errors listed in \r\nexample 1 are all present in this example\r\n\r\n3 page does not load completely most if not all of the screennames in the \r\nbuddy list are missing and some or all of the accounts if signed into

close \r\ni just needed to close it later all attempts to start it again failed i \r\ntried from start menu from another shortcut i had and from cmd providing \r\nfull path to chromeexe i also tried with the nosandbox directive \r\nalways the same result no hourglass no error no indication i had even \r\ntried to launch the app i rebooted the vista sp1 with all current \r\nupdates system same result\r\n\r\ni tried going to the chrome installer page from ie and reinstalling \r\nchrome the installer did appear to run but did not complete by starting \r\nchrome subsequent attempts to start chrome failed as above\r\n\r\nfinally i used programs and features to uninstall chrome then \r\nreinstalled this put me back on the 031549 version which did start and \r\nrun correctly  even to the extent of opening all tabs from my prior closed \r\nsession so thats a good thing\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat is the expected result\n\r\ni would have expected some sort of error or crash report to pop up on
